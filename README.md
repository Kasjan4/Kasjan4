I am a creative developer and team player with great communication. I have been exposed to a wide variety of modern technologies and believe to have an understanding of full stack development and consider myself to be very adaptable. Iâ€™m looking for a role where I can expand my knowledge and work on modern technologies and languages.

## Technologies & Languages

- HTML & CSS (Bootstrap, Responsive, Flexbox, Animations, Forms)
- JavaScript ES6 (Vanilla, jQuery plugins, JSON)
- React (Hooks, Express, JSX, Webpack, Babel)
- Node, JSON web token, Axios, Bcrypt
- SQL (PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, Marshmallow)
- NoSQL (MongoDB, Mongoose)
- REST API's
- Python (Vanilla, Flask, Pipenv)
- Git (GitHub, Work flow, project deployment)

ðŸ¥… My goal for 2021 is to find a frontend role in a creative company.
