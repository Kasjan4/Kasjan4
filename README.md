### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

![README](./readme.png)

I am a Junior Software Developer. For me learning new technologies and a passion for front end development is what made me go into this industry. Orderliness and creativity are some of my traits. For my future I want to be recognised highly for my skills in the industry.
